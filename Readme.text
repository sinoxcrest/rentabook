1-Check if the port is used by any other terms in this case I use port 8080
Open CMD with administrator then type
netstat -ano | findstr :8080
after pressing enter you will see the port used by the PID
then type
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
press enter and kill the task
2-After that include all the maven dependency on the pom.xml
3-Run the application
4-Go to localhost://8080 in my case
5-Application is good to go
